# Avocado Server CE (Community Edition)
###### An opinionated setup for a modern RESTful Server
My architect experience and passion for Java into this project to experiment the new modern technologies.
Instead of configuring everything from scratch we can just import or take inspiration from the features of this project.

> Computer Science is experimentation, automation and engineering (...).

So those Apps are also a playground to experiment new frameworks and new features.

# Requirements
- Java 8
- Gradle 4.x / Maven 3.x
- MySql 5.7.x
- Tomcat 8.5.x
- Suggested IDE: _IntelliJ IDEAâ„¢_

# Features
**Note:** _All features are under deep analysis with continuous development; Features will be added step by step._
